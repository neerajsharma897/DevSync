          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>Welcome to DevSync. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you about how we look after your personal data (as a Data Principal) when you visit our website, and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p>
          
          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We may collect, use, store, and transfer different kinds of personal data about you, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> First name, last name, username.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Data:</strong> Email address.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> IP address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use our website and services, including chat logs and project data.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To register you as a new user.</li>
            <li>To provide and maintain our Service.</li>
            <li>To manage our relationship with you.</li>
            <li>To improve our website, products/services, marketing or customer relationships.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Third-Party Subprocessors and AI Processing</h2>
          <p>We use specific third-party service providers (subprocessors) to deliver the DevSync platform. We maintain Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with each of these providers to ensure your data is handled securely and in compliance with global privacy laws.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Google Gemini (AI Processing):</strong> DevSync utilizes Google Gemini to provide intelligent features like sprint retrospectives, task duration estimates, and CI failure summaries. 
              <strong>Data Scope:</strong> The Gemini API receives strictly scoped data required for the task. For example, sprint summaries only receive task titles, generic statuses, and assignee names. CI failure summaries only receive the final few thousand characters of anonymized build logs.
              <strong>Privacy Guarantee:</strong> We explicitly ensure our AI prompts do NOT expose user email addresses, private chat logs, or non-essential personal data. Google does not use data submitted via the Gemini API to train their foundational models.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Supabase (Database & Storage):</strong> We use Supabase for our core database and file storage infrastructure. Supabase stores user account data, workspace configurations, chat messages, and uploaded files. Supabase operates under strict SOC2 compliance and encrypts data at rest and in transit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SendGrid (Email Provider):</strong> We use Twilio SendGrid to send transactional emails (like password resets and workspace invitations). SendGrid receives the recipient's email address and name solely for the purpose of delivering these messages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>GitHub (OAuth & Integrations):</strong> If you connect GitHub, DevSync uses OAuth tokens strictly to read your repositories for CI/CD status and PR synchronization. Tokens are securely encrypted and DevSync only accesses the repositories you explicitly authorize. We do not store your source code.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>5. Data Retention Policy</h2>
          <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as your account is active. Upon account deletion, all personal data is permanently erased within 30 days, except where retention is strictly required for legal, regulatory, or tax compliance purposes.</p>
          
          <h2>6. Your Legal Rights</h2>
          <p>As a Data Principal under the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, you have specific rights in relation to your personal data, including the Right to Information about your personal data, the Right to Correction and Erasure, the Right of Grievance Redressal, and the Right to Nominate a representative.</p>
          
          <h2>7. Grievance Officer / Identity of Data Fiduciary</h2>
          <p>We have appointed a Grievance Officer who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy policy. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact them using the details set out below:</p>
