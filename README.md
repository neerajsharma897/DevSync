DevSync is an enterprise-grade project management and real-time collaboration platform designed specifically for software development teams. By seamlessly integrating Kanban-style issue tracking, agile sprint management, and threaded chat channels into a single cohesive interface, DevSync eliminates context switching and accelerates team velocity.

## ✨ Features

- **Hierarchical Organization**: Structure your company with **Workspaces** and silo work into distinct **Projects**.
- **Agile Project Management**:
  - Interactive **Kanban Boards** with fluid drag-and-drop mechanics (`@dnd-kit`).
  - Native support for Epics, Stories, Tasks, Bugs, and Subtasks.
  - **Sprint Planning**: Time-boxed iterations with velocity tracking and backlog prioritization powered by LexoRank ordering.
- **Real-Time Communication**:
  - WebSockets-powered (`Socket.io`) instant messaging.
  - **Project-Scoped Channels** and Workspace-wide discussion rooms.
  - Threaded replies, direct messaging, and rich-text formatting (`Tiptap`).
- **Deep GitHub Integration**:
  - Connect repositories directly to projects.
  - Auto-link commits to tasks via smart commit messages.
  - Real-time CI/CD workflow monitoring directly from the Kanban board.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**:
  - Two-layered **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** securing both Workspace (`Owner`, `Admin`, `Member`) and Project (`Project Admin`, `Developer`, `Viewer`) boundaries.
  - Secure OAuth 2.0 flows via Supabase Auth.
